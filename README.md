# BotNuker
A Discord Server Nuker made in Python, Create a bot and add it to the target server, then run this file :)




Using tool is pretty simple.

Invite the bot to the target server by going to OAuth2 URL Generator in your discord application (https://discord.com/developers/applications)

select BOT then go to Bot Permissions and select administrator.

then copy the generated url and paste it into your browser, then select the server of choice and invite the bot to it.

to use this tool you must create a discord bot and then copy the discord bot token.

then in config.txt put the bot token there.

Now run lambdaNuker and ensure you have a VPN enabled or else you will be rate limmited.
then it should say the following:
botname#xxx has connected to Discord!
Processing server: server_name
Created text channels in server 'server_name'

I hope you like this project and if there are any issues lmk :)
